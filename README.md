Repository containing Python GUI tests for RUM-AIR

Refer to this README to know what each file was created for

OV.py is the official Version of the fully functional code

--- SVRV stands for Second Version with Random Values
--- frame_test contains the first draft, made to test how tkinter works and to test the frames
--- hello_world is the first test to dynamically change a display after a certain amount of time
--- join_forces was made to test the two different windows at the same time. This window would later become the tabs in the official GUI.
--- FVRD stand for First Version with Random Values
--- modifications is an attempt to convert the first version to the second version
--- notebook_test was made to implement the notebook aspect of the GUI (needed to include different tabs)
--- payload_test is the first draft of the DATA tab of the GUI
--- sec_draft is the second draft of the first version of the GUI
--- test_connection was made to implement the communication of Python and the Arduino
--- test_connection2 was the second attempt made to implement the communication of Python and the Arduino
--- test_flight1 is the First Version of the GUI with the Arduino communication

*** Versions with random values do not need communication with the arduino to run
*** Versions with arduino communication must have the arduino connected in order to run. Will throw error if not connected."""
